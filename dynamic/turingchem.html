    margin:35px 0 36px;      > The Turing Machine (TM) is a model of computation which is well-known as being a formalisation of what a computer is. It is a machine which has some internal states (from a set S), has a head which read/writes symbols (from a set A) on a tape. The tape is seen as an infinite word made of letters from A. The set A has a special letter (call it "b" from blank) and the infinite words which describe tapes have to be such that all but a finite number of letters of that word are different from "b". Imagine an infinite, in both directions, tape which has written  symbols on it, such that "b" represents an empty space. The tape has only a finite part of it filled with letters from A, others than the blank letter. </ul>
    
  <ul     padding:30px 0 36px 35px;
    margin:35px 0 36px;      >  The action of the machine depends on the internal state and on the symbol read by the head. It is therefore  a function of  the internal state of the machine (element of S), the letter from the tape which is read (element of A), and outputs a letter from the alphabet A (which is written in the case where previously was the letter which has been read,   changes its internal state,  and the head moves one step  along the tape, to the left (L) or right (R), or does not move at all (N).  </ul>

(Pedantically this is seen as a multi-headed TM without internal states; the only interest in this distinction is that it raises the question if there is really any meaning into discerning internal states from the tape symbols.)  We start from a set (or type) of internal states S. Such states are denoted by A, B, C (thus exhibiting their type by the type of the font used). There are 3 special symbols: &lt; is the symbol of the beginning of a list (i.e. word), &gt; is the symbol of the end of a list (word) and M is the special symbol for the head move (or of the type associated to head moves). There is an alphabet A of external states (i.e. tape symbols), with b (the blank) being in A. </ul>

It supposed that all rewrites are context independent, i.e.  LT is replaced by RT regardless of the place where LT appears in the tape word. The rewrite is called "local" if the lengths (i.e. number of letters) of LT and RT are bounded a priori.</ul>

This means that there is never the case that two LT from two different rewrites overlap. It might be the case though, if we formulate some rewrites a bit differently. For example, suppose that the Turing rewrites are modified to: 
    <ul><li> a A  &nbsp; - - > &nbsp; d B M   &nbsp; , for the Turing instruction (A, a, B, d, R)</li>
    <li> a A  &nbsp; - - > &nbsp; d M B   &nbsp; , for the Turing instruction (A, a, B, d, L)</li></ul>

    margin:35px 0 36px;      > Therefore, the LT of the Turing rewrites is no longer of the form "a A c", but of the form "a A". Then it may enter in conflict with the other rewrites, like in the cases: 
    <li> a A M c  where two overlapping rewrites are possible <ul>
    <li>Turing rewrite: a A M c   &nbsp; - - > &nbsp; d M B M c  &nbsp which will later produce two possibilities for the head moves rewrites, due to the string M B M </li> 
    <li> head moves rewrite:  a A M c   &nbsp; - - > &nbsp; a c A &nbsp which then produces a LT for a Turing rewrite for c A, instead of the previous Turing rewrite for a A </li>
    </ul></li> 
    <li> a A &gt;  where one may apply a Turing rewrite on a A, or a blank rewrite on A &gt;</li></ul>    
    
 <ul     padding:30px 0 36px 35px;
    margin:35px 0 36px;      > The list is non exhaustive. Let's turn back to the initial formulation to the Turing rewrites and instead let's change the definition of a tape word. For example, suppose we allow multiple TM heads on the same tape, more precisely suppose that we accept  initial tape words of the form &lt; w1 A w2 B w3 C ... wN &gt;. Then we shall surely encounter conflicts between head moves rewrites for patterns as a A M B c.   </ul>  
    
<ul     padding:30px 0 36px 35px;
    margin:35px 0 36px;      > The most simple solution for solving these conflicts is to introduce a priority of rewrites. For example we may impose that blank rewrites take precedence over head moves rewrites, which take precedence over Turing rewrites. More such structure can be imposed (like some head moves rewrites  have precedence  over others). Even new rewrites may be introduced, for example rewrites which allow multiple TMs on the same tape to switch place. </ul>

Following the conventions from this work, the tape letters (i.e. the alphabet A) are "b" and "1", the internal states are A, B, C, HALT. (The state HALT may get special treatment, but this is not mandatory). The rewrites are:

Indeed,  one internal state symbol (one head on the tape) imposes a sequential deterministic evolution, but it is not resilient to randomness.  </ul>

    margin:35px 0 36px;      >   Remark that the LT and the RT of any rewrite are transformed into pieces of graphs which have loose ends (these are the external links which connect a port from the LT or RT pattern with the rest of the graph).  In the mol notation they are nothing but lists of nodes with named ports. The rewrite becomes a graph rewrite, which consists into cutting of a small graph (the LT in graphical form), tagging of the loose ends of the LT pattern with the name of the respective ports and replacing it  by another small graph (the RT in graphical form),  by using the tags of the loose ends of the LT pattern in order to connect the RT pattern correctly.   </ul>

    margin:35px 0 36px;      >   For example the first blank rewrite  &lt; X &nbsp; - - > &nbsp; &lt; b X &nbsp;  transforms into 
    FRIN 1 , X 1 2 &nbsp; - - > &nbsp; FRIN 1 , b 1 w ,  X w 2 &nbsp; , where w is any fresh port name. The difference between a rewrite and a graph rewrite is that the LT and the RT patterns are not formed by successive elements in a list. If we think about the mol notation for  a tape word, then to each symbol from the tape there is a corresponding line in the mol file which represents that symbol. But the order of the lines in the mol file is arbitrary, so the LT pattern for the graph rewrite (from this example) is a set (not  a list) of lines from the mol file. The information about the graph is in the repetition of the ports names.</ul>
